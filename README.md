# Subtitles merger
This is a very simple subtitles merger used by me to join two subtitle files (in different languages) into one single subtitle file. I use this to watch Hungarian movies with Hungarian subtitles... and if the movie is too difficult I use the "merged" subtitles:

````
00:05:31.33 -> 00:05:33.08
Mit csin√°lsz itt, faszi?
<i>What are you doing here, mate?</i>
````

In this way I can follow the conversation without having to disable the original subtitles. Using subtitles in an easy language (while the movie is in a more difficult language for you) makes you not pay attention to what they say. So always watch movies with their original subtitles _if you are trying to learn the language_.

## Usage
 - Local: Download only the `/build folder` if you are just interested in using the merger. Then access the folder and run `index_local.html`
 - Online: Just access https://nicojones.github.io/subtitles/build/index_local.html
